Tyler Whitmarsh and Jeremy Pearson
cs 454 Project 2

To run the program just type python main.py into the Blue terminal wherever the file is located.
It will enter the user into a loop asking for values of N between 1 and 99999 and a subset of digits S from the language {0, 1, 2,..., 9}.
Our program will then find the smallest integer K such that K % N == 0 and K consists of ony digits in the subset S.
Entering -1 will exit the program.

Contribution:
Tyler: logic and code of DFS and delta function to build parent label and visited lists. 
Jeremy: Handled user input and the traversal of the parent and label lists to get resulting output
Helped fix a bug in DFS function.
Pair programming used for most of project so 50/50 effort.
